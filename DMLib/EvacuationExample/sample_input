Jill: There is a nuclear release and we need to plan evacuation
Jim: Where is the release site?
Jill: It is at the Crystal River Nuclear Power plant
Jim: Show me the twenty thirty and forty mile EPZ Zones around the plant
Jill: It might be OK to evacuate people within twenty mile EPZ zone
Jim: I suggest we use thirty mile EPZ zone for evacuation to stay on the safe side
Jill: OK. Let's use thirty mile EPZ zone instead
Jim: Let us add a plume model
Jill: What is the wind condition to be applied?
Jim: Use the current wind condition
Jill: Let us order evacuation of people within thirty mile EPZ zone and the plume model
