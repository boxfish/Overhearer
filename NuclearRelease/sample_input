Jill: There is a nuclear release at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Station and we need to plan response actions
Jim: OK. Then we need to identify impacted area first
Jill: We need to generate a plume model based on current wind condition
Jim: Based on the protective action recommendations, I think we should plan evacuation within the five mile EPZ plus the downwind plume zone
Jill: I suggest we should evacuate everyone in the ten mile EPZ to increase our margin of error
Jim: OK. Then we need to set up the care centers for the evacuation
